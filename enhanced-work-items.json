    "type": "Spike",
    "state": "Closed",
    "summary": "In-House Email Management System Design Research Completed technical research and design work to replace SendGrid templating with a CX-owned in-house email management system for template creation and delivery. The spike evaluated architecture options, template management approaches, and sending infrastructure requirements to reduce vendor dependency and increase control over email customization. The recommended design establishes the foundation for an in-house email platform supporting dynamic branding, improved deliverability, and reduced SendGrid licensing costs. This research enables future development of a fully self-managed email solution.",
    "fullDescription": "We desire to move away from SendGrid templating to an in-house system to manage e-mail templates and sending.  This would render SendGrid as nothing more than an e-mail server, as we would be managing the various e-mail templates ourselves and coding a solution to construct templates into fully-formed HTML to send to SendGrid.\n\nWe need to answer some questions around this work:\n\n- The recommended implementation would use an Azure Function to process e-mail requests and send them off to SendGrid for delivery.  This would respond to Azure Service Bus queue messages.  Are there better options?\n- How are we going to manage template HTML?  A suggestion was to use Razor pages, which gives us design-time capabilities within Visual Studio.  However, Azure Functions does not support Razor view rendering natively, so this requires research (e.g. [Razor Templating Engine to render Razor Views(.cshtml files)](https://github.com/soundaranbu/Razor.Templating.Core)).  If this is not possible/desirable, other solutions will be required.\n- Templates would be stored in a database table, which combines the various Razor Page pieces into a unified e-mail.  Aside from the actual template-body data, additional metadata may be required to appropriately select a template to match branding/other requirements.\n\nThe outcome of this spike should be a recommendations/design document showing a proposed solution.  Further stories can then be created for implementation.",

    "releaseNote": "<strong>Submitted Loan Applications Migration Console App</strong><p>Built a console application that processes loan lists generated during the Bank Loan Copy orchestration run and calls the submitted loan applications migration endpoint for each affected loan. This tool enables CX engineers to retry and complete migration steps that previously failed due to missing <code>targetLO</code> data during orchestration. The application directly supports the Bank Loan Copy project by ensuring all affected loan applications are fully migrated, reducing manual intervention and improving data integrity across the platform. </p>"
